**Questions to consider _before_ you try to articulate your central idea:**

*   Why did the author focus on this particular bird or group of birds?
*   Why did the author write at this particular moment in time?
*   Why should we trust the author’s observations? Insights?
*   Is there any evidence of tension between the author’s view of this bird and more commonly held views?
*   What effect does the author aim for?

**Questions that may help you articulate your central idea:**

*   Why did you choose this text?
    *   What is it about the text that intrigues you or bothers you?
    *   Can you point to specific passages that prompted your response?
*   What would you like your readers to understand about this text that they might not have noticed or considered on their first reading of it?
*   Why does this aspect of the text matter? What does it reveal about the text as a whole? About some larger issue?
*   How can you help your readers share your understanding of the text?
    *   What is the logical starting point for your essay?
    *   What is the logical sequence of points within your essay?

Preparation for essay (required): Request approval of planned focus for your essay by Session 4. Send the instructor a two-sentence description of your focus and thesis. The earlier you send this email, the sooner you will receive a response.

Guidelines for essay:

*   1st draft should be 3–4 pages long (1000–1300 words, double-spaced).
*   Use MLA in-text citations. Remember Works Cited list.
    *   See publication information below for Beston, Eiseley, and additional Carson material.
*   Edit and proofread your draft before submitting it.
*   Post a copy on the class site by Session 5 and bring three copies to class.

Guidelines for introduction:

*   Avoid cosmic claims. Focus on your particular work.
*   Assume that your readers are thoughtful and open-minded.
